    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The visualization below shows positions taken by groups on bills from the 112th and 113th Congresses (2011 &mdash; 2014) that came up for a vote in at least one chamber. The theory is, by looking at the number of bills supported / opposed by a given group, we can estimate its level of engagement and gauge whether events in Congress are working for or against the groups' interests. By focusing on bills that made it all the way to a vote, hopefully we&rsquo;re filtering out bills introduced as symbolic gestures or used for political grandstanding.</p>

<p>The data for this visualization comes from <a href="http://maplight.org/">MapLight</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. The CRP, as part of its <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php">Open Data Initiative</a>, compiles and releases large bungles of campaign finance data, including codes for industries and organizations. MapLight pulls in that data for reference while <a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill">painstakingly cataloging</a> those organizations support and opposition to versions of proposed bills.</p>

<p>There is profound truth in this bit of humor, but it seems not to have reached contenders in presidential debates.</p>

<p>For some reason, debates are treated like games of sport. Players win by blood and sweat alone. In the same way you don’t get to pro ball by controlling a robotic pitcher during tryouts, you can’t bring an iPad with you to a presidential debate (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/110073567/The-2012-Debates-Memorandum-of-Understanding-Between-the-Obama-and-Romney-Campaigns">it’s actually against the rules</a>).</p>

<p>But while a ban on machines makes sense in the context of playing baseball, the same logic doesn’t hold when your goal is to govern effectively. More than that, those rules actually hurt the quality of debates by pushing candidates to rely on ill-conceived anecdotes and “he said”, “she said” arguments.</p>

<p>Give them computers, and let them cite the studies that support their ideas. Then let their opponents pull up those studies and call bullshit when they see who funded them. I’m more interested in who can quickly verify or refute information than I am in who can convey a more touching story about how the “American way” is in trouble.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not against &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo;, and frankly, I don&rsquo;t think you are either. Even the most extreme of us (that still believe in some form of governed society) expect the government to protect us from physical threats to our safety, and that alone makes it massive. Unfortunately, it also leads to systems that no single person can understand, and <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the real problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m against <em>complex</em> government. The complexity of our laws and institutions allows things to hide, costs us as taxpayers, and ultimately undermines confidence in our shared institutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr83">spending bill</a> that just passed the house and senate was fought over by people concerned with &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo;, and consequently does nothing to address complexity. Buried in its 1603 pages are all manner of arcane clauses. There&rsquo;s a finance provision, forged by lawyers for Citigroup, designed to cut the bindings that Dodd-Frank (itself impossible to understand) was supposed to create. And possibly more insidious, a section slipped into the back of the bill increases the amount of influence wealthy individuals can have by bumping up certain campaign contribution limits tenfold.</p>

<p>The concrete effects of these clauses will be extremely difficult to measure, in no small part because the systems they modify are already complicated and riddled with loopholes. But that &ndash; ironically &ndash; makes the broader implications clear. The special interests and lawmakers writing these laws have no interest in clarity or transparency, and so there won’t be any. Wealthy individuals will discreetly wield even greater influence, large financial institutions will make risky bets at taxpayer expense, and the other groups that got something appended to this bill will take their money and leave us with a more complicated, less efficient system. And if that’s not a recipe for disillusionment, I don’t know what is.</p>
