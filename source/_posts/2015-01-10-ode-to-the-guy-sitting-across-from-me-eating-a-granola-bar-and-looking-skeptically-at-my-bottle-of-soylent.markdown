We should be friends, you and I

but instead there’s distrust.

So we sit across this aisle 

eating different things mushed.

I’d argue mines healthier.

You’d swear yours tastes better.

Anyway, shouldn’t we both be trying to murder the guy eating that delicious smelling, cholesterol-packed, egg-and-cheese sandwich?
