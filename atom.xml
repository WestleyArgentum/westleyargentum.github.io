    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most approaches to measuring the influence that different interest groups have in Congress favor quantitative metrics like money spent lobbying vs money saved in tax breaks. But while that kind of data is great at shining a spotlight on an individual corporation, it does little to illuminate the playing field and reveal how much influence groups have relative to one another.</p>

<p>In order to do that, we should look at how closely events in Congress align with the goals of different special interests, especially when there’s contention. When a bill that an interest supports makes it all the way to a vote and passes, it’s indicative of them having more influence than the bill’s opponents. Conversely, when a bill that an interest opposes comes up for a vote and passes, it indicates that they don’t have as much influence as they might like. Played out over many bills and years in Congress, trends emerge.</p>

<p>This is a seemingly straightforward idea, but it quickly leads to complex issues. It can be extremely non-trivial, for instance, to determine whether a group supports or opposes a bill &mdash; its position may hinge on the wording of a single line, which may be revised many times before a vote.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the organization <a href="http://maplight.org/">MapLight</a> has gone to extensive lengths to catalog interest group support and opposition to versions of bills as they pass through Congress. And, by associating organizations using a taxonomy created by the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, they provide us data that’s nicely broken up along economic and ideological lines. This makes it easier to both establish “rivalries” between groups frequently on opposing sides of issues and, based on events in Congress, to ascertain which of the competing interests seem to have more influence.</p>

<iframe src="http://WestleyArgentum.github.io/visualizations/congress-is-a-game/" width="100%" height="705" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Obviously the data deals with groups in a relatively coarse way, nevertheless, it’s clear that extremely wealthy and largely conservative interests were juggernauts in the 113th Congress. The most diametrically opposed groups were the Chambers of Commerce and consumer advocates, but not once, when a bill the two disagreed on came up for a vote, did Congress vote with consumer advocates. And the stories are similarly bleak for others that came up against the Chambers. Only once in twenty-eight recorded instances did Congress vote with labor unions against the Chambers of Commerce (when House Republicans voted against <a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/113-hr-4414/3424702/total-contributions">HR 4414</a>, meant to clarify Expatriate Health Coverage specified in the Affordable Care Act).</p>

<p>Amongst more ideologically focused groups the situation is much the same. Conservative Republican interests were very often at odds with both health and welfare and human rights advocates, but Congress stood firmly with conservatives. They were almost twice as likely to vote against the interests of human rights advocates, and more than twice as likely to vote against health &amp; welfare policy organizations.</p>

<p>The force driving this correlation between support by certain groups and favorable votes in Congress isn&rsquo;t incalculable or hard to guess at. It&rsquo;s money. The groups above that come out on top control massive amounts of political campaign spending relative to their opponents. The conservative Republican interests in conflict with health and welfare policy groups spent an average of <a href="https://github.com/WestleyArgentum/congressional-influence-model">26 times as much</a> on candidates that won seats in the 113th Congress. They outspent human rights advocates by even more &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/WestleyArgentum/congressional-influence-model">300 times as much</a> on average. The Chambers of Commerce, meanwhile, has spent more on lobbying than any other group <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php">every year since 1999</a>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the complex nature of influence in Congress, but we have the data necessary to understand what’s going on. We know which bills different interest groups favor, and therefore which interests are in contention. We also know which groups are winning because we can look at how representatives vote. And it&rsquo;s clear that those with money have the attention of our lawmakers. While we may not be able to look at any individual vote and cry &ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo;, the consistency in the broader picture makes what&rsquo;s really happening undeniable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The visualization below shows positions taken by groups on bills from the 112th and 113th Congresses (2011 &mdash; 2014) that came up for a vote in at least one chamber. The theory is, by looking at the number of bills supported / opposed by a given group, we can estimate its level of engagement and gauge whether events in Congress are working for or against the groups&#8217; interests. By focusing on bills that made it all the way to a vote, hopefully we&rsquo;re filtering out bills introduced as symbolic gestures or used for political grandstanding.</p>

<p>The data for this visualization comes from <a href="http://maplight.org/">MapLight</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">Center for Responsive Politics</a>. The CRP, as part of its <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php">Open Data Initiative</a>, compiles and releases large bungles of campaign finance data, including codes for industries and organizations. MapLight pulls in that data for reference while <a href="http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill">painstakingly cataloging</a> those organizations support and opposition to versions of proposed bills.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extended_mind.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>There is profound truth in this bit of humor, but it seems not to have reached contenders in presidential debates.</p>

<p>For some reason, debates are treated like games of sport. Players win by blood and sweat alone. In the same way you don’t get to pro ball by controlling a robotic pitcher during tryouts, you can’t bring an iPad with you to a presidential debate (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/110073567/The-2012-Debates-Memorandum-of-Understanding-Between-the-Obama-and-Romney-Campaigns">it’s actually against the rules</a>).</p>

<p>But while a ban on machines makes sense in the context of playing baseball, the same logic doesn’t hold when your goal is to govern effectively. More than that, those rules actually hurt the quality of debates by pushing candidates to rely on ill-conceived anecdotes and “he said”, “she said” arguments.</p>

<p>Give them computers, and let them cite the studies that support their ideas. Then let their opponents pull up those studies and call bullshit when they see who funded them. I’m more interested in who can quickly verify or refute information than I am in who can convey a more touching story about how the “American way” is in trouble.</p>

    <link href="http://WestleyArgentum.github.io/blog/2014/12/28/rewards-programs/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-28T20:28:53-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://WestleyArgentum.github.io/blog/2014/12/28/rewards-programs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Credit card rewards programs are arguably the most successful, widest &ldquo;played&rdquo; examples of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamification</a> &mdash; a term with different connotations depending on who you talk to. I&rsquo;m someone who wants to believe in the power of games to do more than entertain, but in this system I’m tremendously disappointed.</p>

<p>Credit card companies make money in part by charging transaction fees whenever customers swipe their cards. These fees are paid by the merchant but are ultimately worked into the price of everything people buy.</p>

<p>In return for spending money, customers receive “points” that can be redeemed for products through the credit card company. Essentially, the price of everything people purchase is increased slightly, the card companies collect that money, and then card holders are able to pick out things their creditor was able to procure on discount. And different cards come with different schemes for awarding points, so the “savvy” consumer can spend hours devising strategies for spending.</p>

<p>This is a terrible game.</p>

<p>By lumping the cost of future purchases into current spending, people are effectively compelled to continue consuming. And by making credit card providers gatekeepers, they’re able to control what people purchase and skim money off for themselves.</p>

<p>Worst of all, there isn’t a way to opt-out. Merchants don’t offer different prices based on whether customers pay with cash or credit (this became <a href="https://www.paymentcardsettlement.com/en">legally possible</a> only in 2013, and visa encourages retailers to <a href="http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/surcharge-considerations-and-requirements.pdf">maintain the status-quo</a>), so any money someone spends without getting points is a windfall for card companies. The Federal Reserve even <a href="http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppdp/2010/ppdp1003.htm">published a study</a> that found these programs resulted in a “nontrivial transfer” from cash-spending to credit card using, and consequently poor to rich, households.</p>

<p>So while I’d love to end this by saying “the only winning move is not to play”, even that won&rsquo;t work.</p>

    <link href="http://WestleyArgentum.github.io/blog/2014/12/15/complex-government/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-15T21:30:23-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://WestleyArgentum.github.io/blog/2014/12/15/complex-government</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not against &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo;, and frankly, I don&rsquo;t think you are either. Even the most extreme of us (that still believe in some form of governed society) expect the government to protect us from physical threats to our safety, and that alone makes it massive. Unfortunately, it also leads to systems that no single person can understand, and <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the real problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m against <em>complex</em> government. The complexity of our laws and institutions allows things to hide, costs us as taxpayers, and ultimately undermines confidence in our shared institutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr83">spending bill</a> that just passed the house and senate was fought over by people concerned with &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo;, and consequently does nothing to address complexity. Buried in its 1603 pages are all manner of arcane clauses. There&rsquo;s a finance provision, forged by lawyers for Citigroup, designed to cut the bindings that Dodd-Frank (itself impossible to understand) was supposed to create. And possibly more insidious, a section slipped into the back of the bill increases the amount of influence wealthy individuals can have by bumping up certain campaign contribution limits tenfold.</p>

<p>The concrete effects of these clauses will be extremely difficult to measure, in no small part because the systems they modify are already complicated and riddled with loopholes. But that &ndash; ironically &ndash; makes the broader implications clear. The special interests and lawmakers writing these laws have no interest in clarity or transparency, and so there won’t be any. Wealthy individuals will discreetly wield even greater influence, large financial institutions will make risky bets at taxpayer expense, and the other groups that got something appended to this bill will take their money and leave us with a more complicated, less efficient system. And if that’s not a recipe for disillusionment, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <id>http://WestleyArgentum.github.io/blog/2014/05/18/using-genetic-algorithms-to-break-things</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few topics have the power to capture the imaginations of computer science undergrads like machine learning. And for many of us, genetic algorithms in particular hold seemingly infinite promise. During your first year or two at school you&rsquo;re on the verge of solving all of the worlds problems using creatures pulled from your mind and made real by your trusty computer.</p>

<p>But then reality sets in, and we become jaded. The awesome AI in the game you&rsquo;re making -that was going to learn to walk, run, and ultimately outpace the player- just keeps finding physics bugs and getting stuck in walls. And the bots you wrote to manage a simulated hedge fund keep triggering massive selloffs and bringing down the whole virtual economy.</p>

<p>By the time we leave school we&rsquo;ve given up on genetic algorithms. &ldquo;Cute,&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;but too opaque and unwieldy to be used in the real world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, maybe our little creatures don&rsquo;t do what we want. Maybe they just like to misbehave &ndash; and maybe that&rsquo;s ok. By embracing the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms we can turn them into some of the best validation tools we have. Let loose, these algorithms might try things that would never occur to us humans, and they might expose terrible bugs along the way.</p>

<p>So instead of trying to cultivate an AI just like a human player, try changing your fitness function to reward something odd, like collision with walls. And maybe bots that make a bunch of money are overrated, perhaps there&rsquo;s something interesting to be learned from bots that try to cause massive market fluctuations.</p>

<p>I think the real promise of genetic algorithms is in breaking things, not in playing nicely within their virtual boxes.</p>
