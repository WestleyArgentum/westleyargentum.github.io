    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not against &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo;, and frankly, I don&rsquo;t think you are either. Even the most extreme of us (that still believe in some form of governed society) expect the government to protect us from physical threats to our safety, and that alone makes it massive. Unfortunately, it also leads to systems that no single person can understand, and <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the real problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m against <em>complex</em> government. The complexity of our laws and institutions allows things to hide, costs us as taxpayers, and ultimately undermines confidence in our shared institutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr83">spending bill</a> that just passed the house and senate was fought over by people concerned with &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo;, and consequently does nothing to address complexity. Buried in its 1603 pages are all manner of arcane clauses. There&rsquo;s a finance provision, forged by lawyers for Citigroup, designed to cut the bindings that Dodd-Frank (itself impossible to understand) was supposed to create. And possibly more insidious, a section slipped into the back of the bill increases the amount of influence wealthy individuals can have by bumping up certain campaign contribution limits tenfold.</p>

<p>The concrete effects of these clauses will be extremely difficult to measure, in no small part because the systems they modify are already complicated and riddled with loopholes. But that &ndash; ironically &ndash; makes the broader implications clear. The special interests and lawmakers writing these laws have no interest in clarity or transparency, and so there won’t be any. Wealthy individuals will discreetly wield even greater influence, large financial institutions will make risky bets at taxpayer expense, and the other groups that got something appended to this bill will take their money and leave us with a more complicated, less efficient system. And if that’s not a recipe for disillusionment, I don’t know what is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few topics have the power to capture the imaginations of computer science undergrads like machine learning. And for many of us, genetic algorithms in particular hold seemingly infinite promise. During your first year or two at school you&rsquo;re on the verge of solving all of the worlds problems using creatures pulled from your mind and made real by your trusty computer.</p>

<p>But then reality sets in, and we become jaded. The awesome AI in the game you&rsquo;re making -that was going to learn to walk, run, and ultimately outpace the player- just keeps finding physics bugs and getting stuck in walls. And the bots you wrote to manage a simulated hedge fund keep triggering massive selloffs and bringing down the whole virtual economy.</p>

<p>By the time we leave school we&rsquo;ve given up on genetic algorithms. &ldquo;Cute,&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;but too opaque and unwieldy to be used in the real world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, maybe our little creatures don&rsquo;t do what we want. Maybe they just like to misbehave &ndash; and maybe that&rsquo;s ok. By embracing the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms we can turn them into some of the best validation tools we have. Let loose, these algorithms might try things that would never occur to us humans, and they might expose terrible bugs along the way.</p>

<p>So instead of trying to cultivate an AI just like a human player, try changing your fitness function to reward something odd, like collision with walls. And maybe bots that make a bunch of money are overrated, perhaps there&rsquo;s something interesting to be learned from bots that try to cause massive market fluctuations.</p>

<p>I think the real promise of genetic algorithms is in breaking things, not in playing nicely within their virtual boxes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Evan Miller <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/why-im-betting-on-julia.html">made an interesting observation in his blog recently</a>: “[Julia is] poised to do for technical computing what Node.js is doing for web development — getting disparate groups of programmers to code in the same language.” Well, I agree, and I might take it further.
