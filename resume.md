### Summary

I enjoy working on interdisciplinary teams taking on creative and artistic work that demands complex engineering. I've helped create indie games, worked on platforms for visualization and simulation, and supported journalists by building tools and furthering research.

Often I contribute as a software developer but I will jump at opportunities to help with on-the-ground reporting and I'm happy to do the work of deploying and supporting useful hardware and software systems.

### Experience

#### Research Engineer, The Intercept (2016-2019)
At The Intercept I worked on a highly interdisciplinary research team. I helped design and implement tools and workflows for handling sensitive documents in secure ways, and I assisted with document discovery and story research.

- Rififi: A distributed database designed to enable the building of safe, collaborative applications that journalists can use in even the most challenging security environments.
- [Trial and Terror](https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/): An award winning data journalism project that highlights some of the problems with prosecutions for international terrorism charges that have happened in the US since 9/11.

#### Fellow, BuzzFeed Open Lab (2015-2016)
I participated in the inaugural batch of the BuzzFeed Open Lab where I worked with artists, hackers, and journalists on hardware and software projects for the newsroom.

- [BuzzBot](https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/buzzbot): A Facebook Messenger bot designed to help journalists connect with people on the ground at events that BuzzFeed News deployed during the 2016 RNC and DNC.
- [Shit VCs Say](https://www.buzzfeed.com/westleyargentum/stuff-vcs-say): An iOS quiz game that takes a critical look at some of the weirder propaganda coming out of Silicon Valley.
- [RSS Puppy](https://github.com/buzzfeed-openlab/rss-puppy): A simple but useful tool designed to monitor RSS feeds in bulk.

#### Engineer, Forio Online Simulations (2012 - 2014)
At Forio I worked to integrate a new scientific computing language called Julia into a platform that ran educational simulations for institutions like MIT, Harvard, and Wharton.

- Mandelbrot: A distributed computing engine that runs Julia code.
- [GeneticAlgorithms.jl](https://github.com/westleyargentum/GeneticAlgorithms.jl): A lightweight framework that simplifies the process of creating genetic algorithms and running them in parallel.
- [Julia Studio](https://github.com/forio/julia-studio): A (long obsolete!) open source IDE for the Julia language.


### Education

#### Recurse Center (2014)
The Recurse Center is a free, self-directed, "retreat for programmers" where participants spend twelve weeks together learning and exploring ideas. I was in the summer 2014 batch, where I worked on a fantasy football-like game about influence in the US Congress.

#### DigiPen (2008-2012)
I graduated from DigiPen with a BS in Computer Science in Real Time Interactive Simulation and a minor in Math. As a student I worked in close-knit teams on independent games, built from scratch in C++. A game I worked on called [Solstice](http://westleyargentum.github.io/solstice-website/) won a number of awards internationally.
